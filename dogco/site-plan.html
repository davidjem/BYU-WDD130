Scroll down and check what people have been buying lately. <br> All dogs are as special as their owners <br> “If you don't own a dog, at least one, there is not necessarily anything wrong with you, but there may be something wrong with your life.”  Roger A. Caras <br> “I like dogs. You always know what a dog is thinking. It has four moods. Happy, sad, cross, and concentrating. Also, dogs are faithful and they do not tell lies because they cannot talk.”  Mark Haddon <br> “A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself.”  Josh Billings <br> “There’s a saying. If you want someone to love you forever, buy a dog, feed it and keep it around.”  Dick Dale
